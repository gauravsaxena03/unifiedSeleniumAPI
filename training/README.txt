o	UnifiedSeleniumAPI-Intro.ppt: Presenter to use for introduction to usAPI.  Distribute to participants
o	UnifiedSeleniumAPI-Intro-Handout.doc: provide hard/soft copy to participants.  Contains details on setting up a local 
	usAPI test development environment
o	UnifiedSeleniumAPI-HandsOnExercise.ppt: Presenter to use during hands-on exercise.  Distribute to participants.

o	./java: folder containing src files with solutions to hands-on exercise



Day 1
-----

o	30-45 minute presentation on USAPI.  Presenter to use UnifiedSeleniumAPI-Intro.ppt
o	Distribute UnifiedSeleniumAPI-Intro-Handout.doc to all participants (hardcopy and softcopy)

For the remainder of day 1 participants are expected to create a USAPI test development environment on their computers, 
following instructions in UnifiedSeleniumAPI-Intro-Handout.doc.  Depending on level of expertise/experience, some 
participants may have completed the required tasks within 1 hour or less, leaving most of their day available for 
their 'regular tasks'.


Day 2
-----

o	Hands-on Exercise.  Depending on proficiency of participants, this can take between one to two days.
o	Presenter to use UnifiedSeleniumAPI-HandsOnExercise.ppt
o	Participants to receive hardcopy and softcopy of UnifiedSeleniumAPI-HandsOnExercise.ppt which is to be printed with 
	1 slide and associated notes page on a physical page.  Including the notes is critical to successful completion of 
	this training class.
o	UnifiedSeleniumAPI-HandsOnExercise-Solutions.doc contains solutions for the individual tasks of the hands-on exercise. 
	To be used by presenter as participants work through the tasks, switch projector from UnifiedSeleniumAPI-HandsOnExercise.ppt 
	to UnifiedSeleniumAPI-HandsOnExercise-Solutions.doc.
o	Files in the java subdirectory (java/*) contain complete solution files for the hands-on exercise
